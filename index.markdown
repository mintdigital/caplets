## _Capistrano Super Powers_

Capistrano is old and busted, right? Time to move on? WRONG! Caplets makes
capistrano the new hotness once again. It brings capistrano into the future
with all your favorite goodies. Git-based deploys and a collection of
useful modules will make your deploys speedy and painless.

Caplets is 1) a replacement deployment strategy that uses git instead of
subdirectories and symlinks and 2) a series of loadable capistrano extensions
to layer on addition functionality. This gives you a solid deployment
foundation with maximum flexibility. Only the tasks you need get run.

Want to use unicorn? `load 'caplets/unicorn'` How about thinking-sphinx?
`load 'caplets/thinking-sphinx'` Bundler? Network filesystem? YAML config
files? Yes, yes, and yes.

## Quickstart

    $ gem install caplets

    # in config/deploy.rb
    require 'caplets'
    load 'caplets/memcached'
    load 'caplets/whenever'
    # etc...
